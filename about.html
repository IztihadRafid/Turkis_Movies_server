    <h2 style="display: flex;">About</h2>
    <p class="about_p">Turkish television series (Turkish: Türk dizileri) have seen significant growth since the 2000s. These dramas are believed to reflect Turkish culture and considered by some to be the country's most well known economic and cultural exports. Turkey had become the world's fastest growing exporter of television series, surpassing Mexico and Brazil as the second-largest exporter of television series after the United States by the mid-2010s. The television industry has played a crucial role in increasing Turkey's popularity in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North Africa.</p>

        <p class="about_p">Turkish series are chiefly produced in Istanbul, following the liberalization of private television in Turkey in the 1990s.Turkish television channels producing dramas include TRT, Kanal D, Show TV, Star TV, ATV, Fox, TV8, and Kanal 7. The Turkish television series market is characterized by intense local competition; out of the 60 series produced annually in the country, almost 50% do not run for longer than 13 episodes due to the strong competition among local channels, which results in the high quality and popularity of the longer-running productions. Each episode of a Turkish drama is typically between 120 and 150 minutes in length, excluding advertisements. However, this does not apply to internet platform series.</p>
        
        <p class="about_p" id="about_p3">Çalıkuşu was the first Turkish TV series to be exported internationally in 1986 to the Soviet Union. Turkish television shows are almost always available in multiple languages, dubbed or subtitled to accommodate the target country's language. The success of Turkish television series has also boosted tourism, as visitors are eager to visit the locations used in their favorite shows. The sudden and massive international popularity of Turkish TV dramas since the 2000s has been widely analyzed as a social phenomenon</p>
